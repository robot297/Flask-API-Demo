# Python's Flask API Demo

Build an API using the flask framework and swagger for API documentation.

## How to Run

Pipfile will contain all the dependencies for running.  I use Pipenv for dependency management.

To make sure you have the latest packages, run `pipenv update` to get the packages.

To run, just run the command `pipenv run python app.py` from command line.

To run the pylint run the command `pipenv run pylint */*.py` in terminal.
